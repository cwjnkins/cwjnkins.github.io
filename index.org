  Computer Science PhD student working with the [[http://clc.cs.uiowa.edu/][Computational Logic Center]],
  matriculated 2017 Aug. Advised by [[http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~astump/][Dr. Aaron Stump]], and research assistantship
  with same developing [[https://cedille.github.io/][Cedille]], an experimental dependent type theory. [[file:assets/cv.pdf][CV]].

  Research interests include the design of programming languages with
  Curry-style type theories, verified elaboration of sophisticated surface language
  features to a simple core theory, dependent types, and categorical semantics
  of datatypes and terminating recursion schemes.

  Creator of Cedille casts 1-9 on /[[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfV0BJz4nltlj-4yWNZ34lw][Cedille Programming Language]]/ YouTube channel.
