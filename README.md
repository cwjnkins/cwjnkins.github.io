![img](assets/me.jpg)

Computer Science PhD student working with the [Computational Logic Center](http://clc.cs.uiowa.edu/),
matriculated 2017 Aug. Advised by [Dr. Aaron Stump](http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~astump/), and research assistantship
with same developing [Cedille](https://cedille.github.io/), an experimental dependent type theory. [CV](assets/cv.pdf).

Research interests include the design of programming languages with
Curry-style type theories, verified elaboration of sophisticated surface language
features to a simple core theory, dependent types, and categorical semantics
of datatypes and terminating recursion schemes.

Creator of Cedille casts 1-9 on *[Cedille Programming Language](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfV0BJz4nltlj-4yWNZ34lw)* YouTube channel.
