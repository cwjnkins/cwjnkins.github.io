![img](assets/me.jpg)

Computer Science PhD student working with the [Computational Logic Center](http://clc.cs.uiowa.edu/),
matriculated 2017 Aug. Advised by [Dr. Aaron Stump](http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~astump/). [CV](assets/cv.pdf).

Research interests include the design of programming languages with
Curry-style type theories, verified elaboration of sophisticated surface language
features to a simple core theory, dependent types, and categorical semantics
of datatypes and terminating recursion schemes.
